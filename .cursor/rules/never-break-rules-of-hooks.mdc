hooks like usestate useeffect usecontext must always be called in the same order

never call hooks inside if else try catch or loops

all hooks must be top level in the component not inside any condition

if you must conditionally compute something use usememo or plain variables not hooks


test the component at runtime to confirm no hook-order warnings
