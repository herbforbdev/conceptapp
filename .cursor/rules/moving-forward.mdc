ðŸŽ¯ Moving Forward - Small Updates & Feature Additions

Preserve Existing Functionality âœ…
Never modify working features unless explicitly requested
Always test that existing functionality remains intact
Use surgical, minimal code changes

Incremental Improvements âœ…
Small, focused updates rather than large refactors
Build on the solid foundation we've established
Maintain the clean architecture and patterns

Consistent Patterns âœ…
Follow the established translation patterns
Use the same styling and component structures
Maintain the existing code organization

Production-First Mindset âœ…
Always ensure changes work in production
Test thoroughly before committing

Keep performance and user experience as priorities
