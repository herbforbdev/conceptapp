all variables functions and props used must be declared before use.

check for undefined or null values before accessing object properties.

always provide a unique key when rendering lists.

never assume data is present without validating with optional chaining or guards.

test each modified component in the browser to ensure it runs without error.


never push code that causes crash warnings or red screens.
