Surgical Code Changes
* Only modify the minimal lines necessary to implement the requested feature or fix.
* Never refactor or rewrite working code; keep unrelated parts untouched.

Preserve Translation File Structure
* When adding or updating keys in lib/translations/fr.json or lib/translations/en.json, follow the exact nesting and ordering you see in those files.
* Ensure that every new key in one language has a corresponding entry (same path) in the other.

Follow React Best Practices
* Use functional components and hooks correctly to avoid common pitfalls (e.g. stale closures, missing deps in useEffect).

* Adhere to the React Hooks Rules and ESLint-plugin-React best-practice rules to prevent “react/jsx-no-bind” (130) errors in production.
