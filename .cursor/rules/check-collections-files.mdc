always check collections.md and masterdata collections.md for master data references

these files contain the full firestore structure for collections like products, expense types, and activity types.

before adding, editing, or referencing any master data, review these files for the correct field names, data types, and structure.


if unsure about a field or format, confirm it from these files first.
